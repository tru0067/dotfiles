# Gnome and GTK settings
`tweak.sh` contains a short script that does some settings for the gnome shell.

My GTK rc files really just set the theme.

`gtk-2.0/.gtkrc-2.0` goes in `~/`.

`gtk-3.0/settings.ini` goes in `~/.config/gtk-3.0/`. Afaik, for my uses, it can
also go in `~/.config/gtk-4.0/` just fine.
