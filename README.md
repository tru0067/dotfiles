# My system configuration files

##### Alacritty
Terminal colorscheme, that's about it.

##### Vim
A bare minimum `.vimrc` as well as my `init.vim`.

##### Zsh
Aliases and prompt.

##### `deploy.sh`
A script that automatically links each of the system's config files to the ones in this repository.
Note that in some cases this will overwrite any existing system config files.

Nothing at the moment :D
