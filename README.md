# My system configuration files

##### Alacritty
Terminal colorscheme, that's about it.

##### Vim
Sane defaults for vim, as well as a bare `init.vim` for neovim.

##### Zsh
Aliases and prompt.

##### `deploy.sh`
A script that automatically links each of the system's config files to the ones in this repository.
